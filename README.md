# Financial-Risk-Analysis-for-Loan-Approval-SQL-Power-BI-
Description: This project focuses on analyzing loan data to identify key factors contributing to financial risk and to understand patterns in loan approval performance. By leveraging SQL for robust data preparation and aggregation, and Power BI for interactive visualization, this solution provides actionable insights for lenders and financial institutions.

## Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics of loan applicants, specifically distinguishing between approved and declined loans based on various financial and demographic attributes. The analysis aims to uncover correlations that influence loan approval decisions and highlight potential risk indicators. The insights derived can assist in refining lending policies, improving risk assessment models, and optimizing the loan approval process.

## Key Features:
1) Data Acquisition & Integration: Utilized a Kaggle dataset containing comprehensive loan application details.
2) SQL Data Transformation & Aggregation: Cleaned and transformed raw data (e.g., converting ApplicationDate from text to date datatype).
Aggregated key financial metrics (average age, income, assets, liabilities, savings, job tenure, debt-to-income ratio) and applicant counts.
Segmented analysis by year and loan approval status (Approved vs. Declined) to identify temporal trends and performance disparities.
3) Interactive Power BI Dashboard: Developed a dynamic and intuitive dashboard for visualizing crucial loan performance metrics.

## Features include: 
1) Overview of total applicants and approval trends over time. 
2) Comparative analysis of average financial indicators (income, assets, liabilities) between approved and declined loans.
3) Breakdowns by various applicant attributes to identify risk profiles.
4) Identified potential drivers of loan approval success and indicators of financial risk, providing a foundation for data-driven decision-making in lending.

## Technologies Used
### SQL (MySQL Workbench):
Database management, Data cleaning, type conversion.
Using Complex data aggregation (AVG(), COUNT(), ROUND(), GROUP BY).
Conditional logic (CASE statements).

### Power BI Desktop:
Data modeling and relationship management.
Creation of interactive visualizations (charts, graphs, tables).
